# word-families
Get a list of words which are graphemically close (made with generative AI)

Input a list of words you want to compare to each other. For each word, the site will give you a list of words which are formally closest. In this way, you can create so-called 'word families'. I whipped this up using ChatGPT in five minutes for a colleague.
